      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am Amandeep Sohal, a masters student at Kennesaw State University. I am pursuing a masters in Data Science and Analytics. I leverage my computer science background and expertise in Java, Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau and web development to translate complex data into impactful narratives. As a skilled data analyst, I utilize Tableau to create clear and engaging dashboards, as demonstrated by my Covid-19 project, and my dashboard I created as an intern at MetroWest Economic Research Center.

My value extends beyond technical skills. I am a proven team player with strong communication and leadership abilities, fostered through academic achievements like Dean's List and Alpha Lambda Delta membership. Additionally, my experience at Dunkin' honed my collaborative and customer-service focus.

I excel at time management, I have experience balancing academic endeavors, professional work, and personal projects. I'm seeking a dynamic and innovative team to contribute my data storytelling expertise, as well as provide new insights and perspectives to teams.</p>
